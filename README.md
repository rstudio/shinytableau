This repo is the home of some experiments with using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) to create [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) [dashboard extensions](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/dashboard_extensions.htm).

**Please be aware that the API is far from stable at this time, and the code may be prototype quality.** This README will be updated with proper documentation when the package becomes safe to use.
