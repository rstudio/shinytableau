# shinytableau

An R package that helps you create Tableau [dashboard extensions](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/dashboard_extensions.htm), using the power of R and Shiny.

## Motivation

Many organizations rely on [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) to provide day-to-day insights from their data. Thanks to Tableau's point-and-click interface and focused feature set, almost anyone can produce attractive and useful visualizations and dashboards.

On the other hand, tasks that are routine to R users can sometimes be difficult or impossible to achieve with Tableau alone. So it's common to use R to preprocess data that is then fed to Tableau, or use Tableau's R integration features to fortify their data tables with columns calculated by R.

**But there hasn't been an obvious way to let Tableau take advantage of R's powerful visualization and reporting capabilities.** The R platform has a capable plotting system in base, powerful grammar-of-graphics frameworks in ggplot2 and plotly, and hundreds of bespoke visualization libraries for specific types of analysis or domains.

**The goal of shinytableau is to let R users create reusable Tableau dashboard extensions, using the power of R and Shiny to generate visualizations that are not achievable with Tableau alone.**

## What can you do with shinytableau?

shinytableau makes it possible for a Tableau user to open up a rectangle in their dashboard, which we can then fill with a Shiny app. This Shiny app can do anything a normal Shiny app can do:

-   Present input controls like sliders, drop-downs, and text boxes.

-   Display reactive outputs like tables, plots, and HTML widgets.

-   Perform arbitrary actions based on events (e.g. button clicks).

Plus, you gain a few additional Tableau-specific capabilities, including:

-   Enumerate any worksheets that are embedded in the same dashboard.

-   Access data from such worksheets as an R data frame.

-   Provide a configuration dialog (also written in Shiny) to give Tableau users a friendly UI for specifying settings for your extension, such as which worksheet to pull data from, what columns to use in your visualization, etc.

## How can I get started?

First, this package isn't for everyone! If you're a Tableau user with no experience writing code for R and/or Shiny, this is not a great place to start. Instead, we'd suggest checking out [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and then [*Mastering Shiny*](https://mastering-shiny.org/).

If you do know R and have written Shiny apps before, welcome! The [overview tutorial](https://rstudio.github.io/shinytableau/articles/shinytableau.html) is the place to start. You'll need a copy of Tableau Desktop, or access to Tableau Server or Tableau Online and an admin friendly enough to whitelist your extensions.

**Note that this package is new and fairly experimental.** At the time of this writing, we are mostly interested in feedback from R/Tableau users. If you're running into problems, or aren't sure if your use case is supported, please [file an issue](https://github.com/rstudio/shinytableau/issues)!

## FAQ

#### I thought Tableau already supports R?

As of this writing, Tableau's support for R is limited to calculated fields and Tableau Prep scripts. Neither of those entry points are useful for embedding R-based visualizations and user interfaces within Tableau dashboards, which is shinytableau's goal.

#### Why wouldn't I just build the whole dashboard in Shiny?

You definitely could---in fact, we'd prefer it!

But there are lots of organizations where Tableau is deeply entrenched, both technically and culturally, and embedding a little bit of Shiny into a lot of Tableau might be an easier sell than replacing a Tableau dashboard that's otherwise doing a fine job.

And while it's certainly more work to design and build shinytableau extensions than Shiny dashboards, the fact that they can be reused by non-coders could be a significant benefit.
